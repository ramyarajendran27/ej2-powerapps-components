# Getting Started with Syncfusion Gantt Code Component in Power Pages Application

This article provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a Power pages application and integrating the Syncfusion Gantt code component.

Power Pages is a low-code platform in the Microsoft Power Platform family, designed for creating secure and responsive external-facing business websites. It facilitates rapid development without extensive coding, integrates with data sources, and inherits robust security features from Microsoft Azure, making it a versatile tool for diverse website needs.

## Prerequisites

- [Published Syncfusion PowerApps solution package](../../README.md#deploying-the-solution-package-in-the-powerapps-portal)

## Create a new Dataverse table

Syncfusion PowerApps Gantt code component requires data to be loaded from a data source. Follow the steps provided in [Create a new Dataverse table](../common/faq.md#how-to-create-a-new-dataverse-table) section to create a new table in Dataverse using the CSV in the Gantt code component [data](../../components/gantt/data/ganttData.csv) folder. Skip this step if you have an existing table with data.

When creating the Dataverse table using [CSV](../../components/gantt/data/ganttData.csv) file, ensure the column names and data types match those in the table below:

| Column Name | DataType   |
|-------------|------------|
| TaskID      | Whole.none |
| TaskName    | SingleLine.Text |
| StartDate   | Date and Time |
| EndDate     | Date and Time |
| Duration    | Whole.none |
| Predecessor | SingleLine.Text |
| Progress    | Whole.none |
| ParentID    | Whole.none |
| Work        | Whole.none |
| Resources   | SingleLine.Text |
| Indicators  | SingleLine.Text |

> [!NOTE]
> When setting up a Dataverse, make sure that the table columns are assigned the correct data types to prevent data loading issues in the Gantt code component.

## Add Syncfusion PowerApps Gantt code component to the Dataverse table

To add the Syncfusion PowerApps Gantt code component to the Dataverse table, follow the steps below:

1. In the Dataverse table, find the `Forms` tab in the Data experiences pane to streamline data management. Locate the `Information` form with the **main** form type to define how users interact with and organize data effectively.

2. Within the left navigation pane of the `Information` form, locate the `Components` tab. Here, click on `Get more components` at the bottom of the tab.

3. A window will appear. Switch to the `Build by others` tab at the top and import the built code component named `SfGantt` from the published solutions.

4. Create a new section in the form, opting for a `1-column tab` from the `popular` section. Rename this tab as **Gantt View** to clearly delineate its purpose. This tab will be utilized to render the Gantt code component.

5. Within the `More Components` section, select the `SfGantt` component. Configure the DataSource property of the Gantt code component by accessing the list of Dataverse tables created previously with respective table views. This step ensures that the Gantt code component is seamlessly connected to the relevant data.

6. Once the data is loaded, include the necessary ganttConfig data for the Gantt code component by accessing the `ganttConfig` property and paste the [**Gantt config data**](../../components/gantt/data/ganttConfig.json).

7. The output of the Gantt code component will appear as shown below. Click the `Save and publish` button at the top right corner of the PowerApps portal. This action commits the changes made to the form, ensuring that the Syncfusion PowerApps Gantt code component is now an integral part of the Dataverse table.

## Create a Power Pages application

To create a Power Pages application, follow the steps below:

1. In the [Power pages portal](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/), click the `Start from blank` option to create a new Power Pages application. And provide a meaningful name for your Power Pages application. Subsequently, click `create` to proceed.

2. The Power Pages platform will generate a blank Power Pages application based on your specifications. You are now ready to start building your application. The created application will be listed in `Active sites` tab. Now. click `Edit` the application to proceed.

7. After updating the permission, click `Edit form` on the form component and select `data` tab on left pane. On that, click the `Open Portal Management app` button under configuration section to open the portal management app in new tab.

8. In the opened Portal Management app, click the `Basic Form Metadata` tab of the `Information` table form. and create **two** new form metadata by clicking the `New Basic Form Metadata` button. And provide the necessary details for the form metadata for `Gantt View` tab and the code component. Finally, click the `Save` button to save the changes. check below screenshots for reference.

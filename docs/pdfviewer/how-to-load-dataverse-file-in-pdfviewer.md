# How to Load Dataverse Files in the PdfViewer Code Component Using PowerAutomate

The Syncfusion PDFViewer code component is a versatile tool for viewing PDF files directly in your application. It supports loading files from multiple sources, including URLs and Base64 strings. This guide walks you through the process of retrieving and displaying a file stored in Dataverse in the PDF Viewer component using Power Automate.

## Prerequisites

## Create a Dataverse table with a file column

To store files in Dataverse, youâ€™ll need to set up a table with a file column. Follow the instructions in [Create a new Dataverse table with file column](../common/faq.md#how-to-create-a-dataverse-table-with-a-file-column-for-storing-files).

## Create and Configure a Power Automate Flow in Canvas Application

## Load Dataverse files in PdfViewer Code Component using PowerAutomate flow

1. **Add a Gallery for File Selection**: In your PowerApps Canvas application, insert a Vertical Gallery control and connect it to the `SF Files` table. Set the `OnSelect` property of the gallery to trigger the flow using this expression:

    ```json
    Set(
      DataverseFile,
      GetFileFromDataverse.Run(
          Match(
              Gallery1.Selected.File.Value,
              "rows/(?<value>[^/]+)/fileimageurl"
          ).value
      )
    );
    ```

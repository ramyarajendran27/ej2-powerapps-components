# How to Load Syncfusion PowerApps RichTextEditor Code Component in PowerApps Form

This article provides a step-by-step guide for How to Load Syncfusion PowerApps RichTextEditor Code Component in PowerApps Form.

## Prerequisites

- [Published Syncfusion PowerApps solution package](../../README.md#deploying-the-solution-package-in-the-powerapps-portal)

## Create a new Dataverse table

Syncfusion PowerApps RichTextEditor code component requires data to be loaded from a Dataverse column. Follow the steps provided in [Create a new Dataverse table](../common/faq.md#how-to-create-a-new-dataverse-table). Skip this step if you have an existing table with data.

Create the Dataverse table as outlined below to connect it with the RichTextEditor component:

| Column Name    | DataType   |
|----------------|------------|
| RichTextEditor | SingleLine.Text |
| Description    | Multiple lines of text |

> [!NOTE]
> When setting up the Dataverse table, ensure that the Description column is configured to support HTML content for compatibility with the RichTextEditor component.

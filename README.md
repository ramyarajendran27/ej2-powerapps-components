## Install the prerequisites

Before starting with the Syncfusion PowerApps Code Components library, ensure the following prerequisites are installed:

- [node.js  (>= v18.20.4)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version is recommended)
- [.NET 6.x SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
- [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction#install-microsoft-power-platform-cli)
- [System requirements for Syncfusion React components](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/system-requirement)

## Clone the repository

Clone the Syncfusion PowerApps components repository to your local machine.

## Creating the Syncfusion code components solution package

To generate a solution project and bundle all Syncfusion code components to create a solution package, follow these steps:

1. Open your command prompt and navigate to the [root folder](./) of this project.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > To avoid build failures, ensure that the entire folder path does not contain spaces. For example, instead of a path like **C:\Projects\My Project**, use `C:\Projects\MyProject` or `C:\Projects\My_Project`.

2. Execute the following commands to install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Place the Syncfusion license key in the [`syncfusion-license.txt`](syncfusion-license.txt) file located in the project's root folder for registration.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A license banner will be visible if the application is run without a Syncfusion license key. To obtain your Syncfusion license key, visit the [Get license key](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/licensing-faq/where-can-i-get-a-license-key) page.

4. Execute the following command to create & pack the solution package:

    ```bash
    npm run pack
    ```

5. The resulting package will be created at [`SyncfusionPowerAppsComponents/bin/release/SyncfusionPowerAppsComponents.zip`](SyncfusionPowerAppsComponents/bin/release/SyncfusionPowerAppsComponents.zip), containing all Syncfusion code component.

## Deploying the solution package in the PowerApps portal

To deploy the solution package in the PowerApps portal, follow these steps:

1. Before proceeding, verify that the file size limit for email attachments in PowerApps is greater than the size of your solution bundle. For detailed instructions, refer to the [FAQ section](./docs/common/faq.md#how-to-set-file-size-limit-for-email-attachments-in-powerapps).

2. Update the `Environment` property in [config](./config.json#L2) with PowerApps solution importing environment name from [PowerApps portal](https://make.powerapps.com/).

    ![Environment PowerApps portal](./docs/images/common/PowerApps-Environment.png)

3. Execute the following command to deploy the solution package in the PowerApps portal in root folder:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you face any difficulties during the automatic importing process, please check the [FAQ](docs/common/faq.md) page for help. For instructions on manually deploying the solution package in the PowerApps portal, visit the [manual deployment](./docs/common/deploy-solution-pack-manually.md) page.

4. After the successful execution of the command, the solution package will be deployed in the [PowerApps portal](https://make.powerapps.com/) under the specified environment in [config](./config.json#L2) as shown below in the opened PowerApps solution page:

    ![Deployed solution package in PowerApps portal](./docs/images/common/PB-DeploySuccess.png)

## Integrating Syncfusion code components into PowerApps applications

Once the solution package is successfully deployed, you can integrate Syncfusion code components into your PowerApps applications. Refer to the [Component List](#components-list) for a comprehensive overview of available components and their respective documentation.

For example, to use the Grid component within a PowerApps Canvas application, check out the [Getting started with Canvas](docs/grids/getting-started-with-canvas.md) guide located in the respective component documentation folder.

## Testing Syncfusion code components locally (using Test Harness)

To update and test Syncfusion code components locally, refer to the `README` file associated with each respective code component listed in the [Component List](#components-list).

For example, to test the Grid code component, navigate to the [README.md](components/grids/README.md) file in the corresponding code component link and follow the provided instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> To upgrade the published solution package, update the `solutionVersion` property in [config.json](./config.json#L7) before repackaging. After modifying the version, execute the `npm run pack` command to generate a new package reflecting the updated version.
